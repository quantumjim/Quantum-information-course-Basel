# Quantum Information

This is a [course at the University of Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/home?id=239410), given by James Wootton of [IBM Quantum](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/st/quantum/).

**Regarding the current health situation, keep track of the [university](https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Coronavirus.html) and [cantonal](https://www.coronavirus.bs.ch/) guidelines. Lectures will be distributed online. Information will be sent by email.**

The course begins on 2nd March 2021 and will have weekly lectures and exercises.

## Course Content

Quantum information theory is the basis of multiple emerging technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum crypotography. It allows us to understand how quantum effects in physical systems may be harnessed for new forms of information processing. The course will also feature some hands on experience with quantum technology, via the open-source Qiskit framework for quantum computing.

## Course Text

The course will be based on the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).

## Lectures

* **Week 1:** What is quantum? What are computers?
  - [The Atoms of Computation](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/atoms-computation.html)
  - [What is Quantum?](https://qiskit.org/textbook/what-is-quantum.html)
* **Week 2:** Basic programming prerequisites (classical and quantum).
  - [Python and Jupyter Notebooks](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html)
  - [Basic Qiskit Syntax](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/qiskit.html)
  - [Hello Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-ex/hello-qiskit.html)
* **Week 3:** Representing single qubit states and gates.
  - [Representing Qubit States](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html)
  - [Single Qubit Gates](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/single-qubit-gates.html)

## Exercises

Some exercises will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These can be run locally by installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). They can also be run online without any installation using the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab). When you are on the files menu of the lab, you can click on the 'upload file' icon to upload notebooks.

The easiest way to to download the exercises is to download the whole repository using [this link](https://github.com/quantumjim/Quantum-information-course-Basel/archive/master.zip).


## Exam: Final Project

Instead of an exam, the plan is to have a Final Project. More details will follow.
