    "For  universal  quantum  circuits,  it  is  possible  to  defer  all  measurements  to  the  end without  loss  of  generality. For example, the circuit on the left below shows a classically controlled-X (which performs the X only when the measurement result is `1`). The circuit on the right shows its replacement by a CX when the measurement is deferred."
