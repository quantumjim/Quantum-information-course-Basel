    "\n",
    "There are an infinite number of possible single qubit states.  From a theoretical stand-point,  the  one  we  choose  to  label $| 0 \\rangle$ is  arbitrary.   So  let’s  consider  the  following alternative.\n",

    "For this $| \\bar 0 \\rangle$:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Find a corresponding orthogonal state $| \\bar 1 \\rangle$;\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)  For this basis $| \\bar 0 \\rangle$, $| \\bar 1 \\rangle$, find mutually unbiased basis states $| \\bar + \\rangle$ and $| \\bar - \\rangle$;\n",

    "(c)  Now find the two basis states for a third mutually unbiased basis\n",

    "## 2. Properties of the Pauli Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Sometimes the Pauli matrices are written as $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, and sometimes as $\\sigma_x$, $\\sigma_y$ and $\\sigma_z$. For  the  most  part,  the  convention  is  an  arbitrary  choice. Once  you’ve used them enough,  you’ll hardly notice the difference (to the great annoyance of your students!).\n",
